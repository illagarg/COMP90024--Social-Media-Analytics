Creating instance and waiting for it to enter the running status

It should all be running very soon...
Thanks for waiting :)


We replaced some of the parameters in our code just now using rpl command

now waiting for the servers to ready and going to call Ansible soon

...


Now deploying DB cluster

Waiting the shell script to run

..

Very quick, cluster should have been set up already


Now setting up the main node as web server, harvester, analyuser


Allow me to check the debug message real quick :)



It can been seen that 3 nodes are set up using docker..

Hopefully we will get something from the browser , or just the curl command


It looks okay in the playbook output, lets started validating from a simple curl command

This file is wriiten to the dir automatically while I was running the 

run.py program


DB seem to be working :))))))


Now check the webserver

Valllaaaaaaaaa!

Altho the website constrution is not fully finished at this stage, 

It can be showed that this automation program is capable of setting up

apache+django envirnment. 

We only need to replace the file and get the website running:)



Thanks for watching! The demo will finish here!
